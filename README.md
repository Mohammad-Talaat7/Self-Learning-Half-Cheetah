# Self-Learning-Half-Cheetah
this project is based on [Simple random search provides a competitive approach to reinforcement learning By Horia Mania, Aurelia Guy, Benjamin Recht research paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.07055)

The incredible Augmented Random Search (ARS) algorithm empowers our model to master the art of walking, emulating the graceful movements of a half cheetah.

The true beauty of this model lies in its elegant simplicity. It sidesteps unnecessary complexities and focuses solely on refining weights by continuously adapting to the rewards gained during simulations.

In contrast to the prevailing reinforcement models, which predominantly explore the action space using gradient descent algorithms and deep learning, our groundbreaking approach delves into the uncharted territory of policy space. By employing straightforward finite differences and leveraging shallow learning techniques, our ARS model boasts a remarkable speed boost of up to 15 times and attains superior rewards in specific applications.

Moreover, our versatile model harnesses the power of pybullet environments, extending its capabilities beyond the realm of the half-cheetah. With minimal adjustments to key parameters, it can seamlessly adapt to various other environments, opening doors to limitless possibilities.
